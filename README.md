# Hospital-Managment-System
Hospital Managment System made with MySQL.

STORYLINE:
Everyone need hospitals everywhere in the world, everyone get sick at one point in their life. This is why a hospital is a very important need in any country in the world but, managing a hospital can be complicated as there is a lot to keep track of. 
The ‘Hospital Management System’ helps to a better patient care and confidentiality, it improves the hospital’s efficiency by making the information easily accessible. The main goal of the management system is to reduce the paper work as much as possible. In the end, this system could be used by any hospital anywhere in the world.
To provide appropriate help, hospitals have to be well organized. For example, we have to keep track of the records of all the employees (doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and other staff members), and the patients.
The idea of the ‘Hospital Management System’ is to make an automated system that will keep track of all the information concerning the staff, patients, medications, appointments, etc. It will keep track of all the activities and maintain their records.



PROJECT FOCUS:
- Staff details
  It keeps track of all the details concerning the staff (doctors, nurses, receptionists…). Doctors’ details are also stored in a different form as they have a role a little bit different than the rest of the staff (they take care of the patients);

- Patient details
  Keeps track of when the patients are admitted and discharged, the patients’ rooms, and personal information;

- Records 
  Keeps track of the patients’ records (if they have an appointment, if they are buying medicine…). The records are accessible by the       patients and also by nurses and doctors;

- Doctors 
  Doctors will have access to a “timetable”, they will be able to see when they have an appointment with which patient and information       about their records;

- Stocks
  Keeps track of the medicine stocks: every time a medicine is prescribed to a patient, that medicine is deduced from the stock.

- Billing 
  This simply gives information about the patients’ bills.
